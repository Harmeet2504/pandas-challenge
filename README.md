This challenge is about analyzing city's school records to make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.The following analyses are conducted:
  **District Summary, School Summary, Top Performing Schools (By Passing Rate), Bottom Performing Schools (By Passing Rate),Math Scores by Grade, Reading Scores by Grade, Scores by School Spending, Scores by School Size, Scores by School Type**


# Observations based on analysis:
1. The obvious trend based on analysis is that Charter schools outperformed District schools with an overall passing rate of Charter school being greater than 20% in comparison to district schools. This is also evident in the statistics of top and bottom performing schools by passing rate. 
2. Schools with low budget per student fared well in comparison to ones with higher budget implying an inverse correlation between budget and school performance. 
3. Small and medium sized schools yielded better results than larger ones.
4. In general across the dataset, students performed better in reading compared to maths irrespective of the grade.
